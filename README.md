- Hi, I’m @William-Weston
- I’m interested in computer programming and computer science in general.
- I’m currently learning CMake & Git. I'm taking online courses at educative.io on those subjects.
- As of 8/03/2024, I just finished both parts of the "Nand to Tetris" course on Coursera and the "Language, Proof & Logic" course from Standford Online.
  I'm always trying to learn something new.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
- I am currently on disability and unable to afford higher education.
  Despite this I am doing everything I can to further my knowledge of computer science so that one day I may be able to contribute back to society in some capacity.
- My goal is to gain enough skills that I will be able to someday contribute to an open source project.
- How to reach me: wjtWeston@protonmail.com
- Fun fact: I have a 8 year old Doberdor (lab, dobermann mix) named Henry.
